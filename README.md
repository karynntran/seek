Seek is a web application meant to help travelers with what can sometimes be the hardest part of traveling, deciding where to go.  Unlike other travel apps which focus primarily on booking and researching the necessities of your trip, Seek intends to give the user a snapshot of a potential destination in an attempt to get the general experience of the city, along with basic weather and consumer price information.  Above all, Seek is built as a celebration of the infinite possibility of global travel. So, Where to?

On the homepage, the user can search through a list of possible destinations before entering the city that he or she is traveling from in addition to an anticipated month to travel, in order to gather relevant weather and flight estimations. 

Once the search queries are submitted, the user is redirected to a results page that displays the hotel, flight, distance, weather, and estimated consumer costs data.  From this results page the user is able to login and save that search query to their unique username so that they can keep a log of possibile travel destinations in mind.
